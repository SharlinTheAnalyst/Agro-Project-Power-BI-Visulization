CEO of Argo-Allied Limited Company is deeply concerned with the
inconsistency in the egg production of 36,000-layer birds, record of daily mortality on
the four pen houses, the rising cost of the feeds and other expenses incurred compared
to revenues.
In addition, the excessive supply of eggs in the market by Obasanjo farm Limited and
other giant large-scale poultry contributed to the fall in the market sale of eggs.
Falanza thought that employees' activities such as feeding time, method of feeding
and medication might also contribute to high mortality and low production rate.
Daily egg collection, mortality and feeding data for 5 years are provided
